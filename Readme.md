Gives the camera tracking capabilities. 

![Features](https://banners.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Features.png)  
Press the 'Home' key (default, can be changed with in-game keybinding settings) while any colonist, enemy, animal or item is selected, and the camera will follow them (including furniture and plants - but they tend to not move much). Alternatively, you can click with the middle mouse button on colonists in the Colonist Bar on top of the screen to toggle following.

**Does not require a new save game**
Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves.
